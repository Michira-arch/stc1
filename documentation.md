# StudentCenter: Your Digital Campus Companion

Welcome to the official guide for **StudentCenter**. This document is designed for anyone who wants to learn how to navigate the app, use its features, and showcase it to others. No technical knowledge is required!

## 💡 What is StudentCenter?

StudentCenter is an "All-in-One" mobile app designed to make university life easier, more social, and more fun. Instead of having ten different apps for food, studying, selling books, and chatting, StudentCenter puts everything in one place.

## 📱 How to Install on iPhone (iOS)

Since StudentCenter is a "Progressive Web App," you won't find it in the App Store. Instead, you "install" it directly from your web browser. This is a very cool feature to show in a demo video!

1.  **Open Safari**: Go to the app's website link.
2.  **Tap Share**: At the bottom of the Safari screen, tap the "Share" icon (a square with an up-pointing arrow).
3.  **Add to Home Screen**: Scroll down the list of options and tap **"Add to Home Screen."**
4.  **Confirm**: Tap **"Add"** in the top right corner.
5.  **Launch**: You will now see the StudentCenter icon on your phone’s home screen. When you open it from there, it feels and acts like a "real" app with no browser bars!

## 🏁 The First Five Minutes

When you first open the app, here is what you should do:

1.  **Onboarding**: You'll see a few welcome screens explaining the app. Swipe through them!
2.  **Sign Up**: Create an account with your email.
3.  **Choose Your Handle**: This is your "nickname" (like @CampusPro). It’s how people will tag you in posts.
4.  **Explore the Theme**: Go to your **Profile** (bottom right icon) and tap the **Settings** gear. You can switch between **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode**. (Note: Dark Mode looks amazing on OLED phone screens!)

## 🏠 The Main Navigation (Bottom Bar)

The app is divided into five main sections. You can move between them by tapping the icons at the bottom or by **swiping left and right** on your screen.

### 1. The Feed (Home Icon)
*   **The Pulse**: This is where you see posts from other students. It’s like a campus-wide notice board and social media feed combined.
*   **Engagement**: You can "Like" a post or leave a comment.
*   **Stories**: At the very top, you’ll see circles. Tap them to watch "Stories"—vertical photos or videos that disappear after 24 hours.

### 2. Explore (Magnifying Glass)
*   **Discover**: See what is trending across the whole campus. It’s the best place to find new people to follow or interesting events you didn't know about.

### 3. Meet & Blind Date (Video Icon)
*   **Meet Rooms**: Create or join video chat rooms. Perfect for a quick group study session or a "virtual coffee" break.
*   **Blind Date**: This is a unique feature! Tap "Start Matching" and the app will find another student for you to talk to. It starts with audio/video, allowing you to meet someone new and exciting in a safe, fun way.

### 4. Create / Editor (Plus "+" Icon)
*   **Share Your Voice**: This is where you go to post. You can upload a photo from your gallery or take a new one, write a caption, and choose if it goes to the "Feed" or your "Story."

### 5. Profile (User Icon)
*   **Your Home**: See your own posts, your followers, and your achievements.
*   **Achievements/Leaderboards**: You can see how you rank against other students based on how active you are in the community.

## 🚀 The "Super Apps" Launcher

In the app, you will see a button that looks like a **Grid of Squares**. This is the **Apps Launcher**. It contains specialized mini-apps for campus utilities:

*   **🍔 Campus Eats**: Browse local campus restaurants, see their menus, and order food for delivery or pickup.
*   **💰 Campus Hustle**: A place for "side hustles." If you need someone to help you move boxes or want to offer tutoring services, this is where it happens.
*   **🛍️ Marketplace**: The campus "eBay." Sell your old textbooks, electronics, or dorm furniture to other students nearby.
*   **📚 UniCampus**: The academic library. Students can upload or request "past papers" (previous exam questions) and study guides.
*   **🔍 Lost & Found**: If you lose your keys or find a wallet near the library, post it here to help it get back to its owner.
*   **🌱 Freshman Starter Pack**: A special guide for new students with maps, "hidden gems" on campus, and essential tips for surviving the first year.

## 🤖 The AI Assistant

Look for the **Floating Robot Icon** in the bottom right corner.
*   **What it is**: Your personal campus assistant.
*   **How to use it**: Tap it anytime to open a chat window. You can ask it things like:
    *   *"How do I order food on Campus Eats?"*
    *   *"What is the most popular spot on campus today?"*
    *   *"Tell me how to list an item for sale."*

## 📹 Video Demo Tips

If you are filming a demonstration, keep these "Pro-Tips" in mind:

*   **The "Liquid" Effect**: Notice the background of some screens has a "liquid" or "moving" effect. It reacts to your touch! Try moving your finger around on the background to show how interactive it is.
*   **Smooth Swiping**: Instead of just tapping icons, show how you can swipe the whole screen left or right to switch between the Feed, Explore, and Profile.
*   **The Story Player**: When watching a story, tap the right side to go forward and the left side to go back.
*   **Live Matching**: If you have two phones, show the **Blind Date** matching process live—it looks very impressive on camera!
